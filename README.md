CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark in machine learning for image recognition.

Code in this directory demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) on both CPU and GPU. We also demonstrate how to train a CNN over multiple GPUs.

Detailed instructions on how to get started available at:
